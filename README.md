# humbucker
A short PHP test project, named after my preference in electic guitar pickups.

## Usage
To bring up the web server, first install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).

Then use `docker-compose up` to launch.

Navigate to [localhost](http://localhost) to see the project.
